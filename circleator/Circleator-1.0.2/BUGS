-z-index seems to be getting ignored, at least by Batik?

-The following text is truncated because the path on which the circular text is rendered starts at 9 o'clock
 and the default text-anchor is middle (at 12 o'clock):

new tl label innerf=0.1,heightf=0.07,label-text=gaps&nbsp;(tiny/small/medium/large),label-type=horizontal

-BioPerl converts all the sequence in GenBank flat files to uppercase, regardless of its original case.
 (TODO: check whether this is actually a feature/misfeature.)

-contig-gaps images don't show anything on predefined track page because the sample data has no contig gaps :)

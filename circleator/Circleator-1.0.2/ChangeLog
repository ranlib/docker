 -Fixed off-by-one bug in the positioning of 'contig' and 'contig_gap' features in multi-contig figures.

 -Fixed bug whereby additional feature filters on tracks using 'feat-track' were ignored.
 -Added the following categories to the --debug command-line option: coordinates,input,loops,misc,packing
 -Added optional 'revcomp' flag to --contig_list file format: including it on a line reverse complements the corresponding input contig.

AMOS Assembler NEWS
===================
The AMOS consortium is committed to the development of open-source whole genome 
assembly software. The project acronym (AMOS) represents our primary goal -- to 
produce A Modular, Open-Source whole genome assembler. Open-source so that everyone 
is welcome to contribute and help build outstanding assembly tools, and modular in 
nature so that new contributions can be easily inserted into an existing assembly 
pipeline. This modular design will foster the development of new assembly algorithms 
and allow the AMOS project to continually grow and improve in hopes of eventually 
becoming a widely accepted and deployed assembly infrastructure. In this sense, 
AMOS is both a design philosophy and a software system.


Version Release History
=======================
